## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- SCSS

### What I learned

This was my first frontend mentor project using javascript. I got some practice using query selectors, creating and calling functions, and passing elements to them for changing their properties. Additionally, it was also my first project using SCSS and I explored it's nesting functionality.

### Continued development

For continued development, I would like to play around with the rating selectors to try and make it so that once a number is selected, it no longer triggers the on hover event.

### Useful resources

- [Fluid Typography calc](https://royalfig.github.io/fluid-typography-calculator/) - Very useful tool in generation of clamp function.
